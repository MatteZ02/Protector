## What is Protector?
Protector is a Discord moderation bot aimed at assisting your staff members by providing tools for automatic moderation.

## What does Protector do?
Protector automatically moderates your Discord server by deleting messages it deems harmful and warning about ones that may be potentially harmful.

## How does Protector work?
We used machine learning and a dataset of over 10,000 messages we created of positive and negative comments in order to train a text classifier that can decide if a message is considered harmful or not.

## Does Protector replace my staff?
No. Protector is meant to be used alongside staff members to aid them with the deletion of harmful messages, this can be done quicker than before since it is fully automatic.

# Future plans
- Making use of translate APIs in order to support multiple languages
- Marking users who have previously sent harmful content
- Allowing user input for training data
- Furhter improvment to the data set
