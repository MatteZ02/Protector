#### **How does Protector work?**
We used machine learning and a dataset of over 10,000 messages we created of positive and negative comments in order to train a text classifier that can decide if a message is considered harmful or not.

#### **Does Protector replace my staff?**
No. Protector is meant to be used alongside staff members to aid them with the deletion of harmful messages, this can be done quicker than before since it is fully automatic.
